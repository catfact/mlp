thinking about loopers again. i'd like to try one with a "multiply" feature. this is an exercise, so  approach it minimally, focusing on supporting only the feature under investigation. (at first.) 

the "multiply" operation on a loop is perhaps most familiar / defining as appears in the oberheim/gibson "echoplex digital pro." various flavors of the feature have appeared in loop pedals, but rarely with much flexibility. so this looper will focus onmanaging multiple loop layers with various heuristics for synchronization and layer management.

began conceptualizing this in supercollider, added `mlp.scd` with stubs. but now i'm not sure SC seems right: things like data transfer between .ar/.kr/logic parts of code, are clunky and imprecise. leaning towards either a graph-based prototype, or straight to c++.

(_softcut_ is also fairly well suited for this sort of thing, but the ability to synchronize voices precisely is not quite up to the requirements. someday i would like to improve on it or build up a new system with all its features; maybe this could be a start...)

this application is also a good candidate for a daisy/petal port: it's simple, has low CPU requirements, and i think a 4-switch interface is about right. so... i'll go straight for the c++ implementation.

end of day: pushed first draft of untested c++ implem. (initially had all the low-jitter boilerplate in there, but too complicated/unnecessary for POC.)

first run of the first-draft program, fixed issues with basic audio setup.

ready to test actual processing, i stepped in a rabbit hole: 
- liblo suddenly seems to not work on my machine, at least during debug (macbook air m1. oddly i don't seem to have used liblo before in any projects on it?) the symptom is frustrating - messages just disappear. 
- i don't want to debug this, so maybe it's time to investigate other options, like `oscpack`
- with `oscpack` i can receive messages (yay.) but, it triggers an assertion because numerical type definitions are wrong for this architecture (boo)
- so i have quickly forked `oscpack` and hacked in a fix. now i must waste a little more time learning its API and porting the POC...

... finished the port, OSC reception seems ok. crashing somewhere...

... fixed crash, fixed layer-reset logic, fixed layer-stop logic. things seem to be working as expected; next up is building out more features (particularly de-clicking crossfades.) 

**NTS**: design-wise, i would love to be able to dynamically re-define things like layer-sync behavior, tap logic etc., to be definable in lua or some other scripting language. but, it's a special challenge to have user-defined script executed on realtime audio thread, and i've yet to build a system that does this well. (have looked at e.g. cockos EEL2, and the possibility of lua with granular control of GC, but the fact is that i don't really enjoy software enough to want to solve those problems.)

implemented crossfading, which seems to be working after a couple bugs. next issues:

- (1) when closing a loop, we immediately update the frame offset for the previous layer, causing a click
- (2) enabling/disabling write/read for a layer is still done by setting a boolean, causing a click
- (3) stopping a layer likewise is a boolean operation that causes a click
- 
... ok, (1) seems fixed
... ok actually threw in a fix for (3) as well.

(2) calls for the general addition of smoothed parameters, probably updated at vector rate, so that seems like a good starting place for next session.

... ok, added "smoothed switches" for overdubbing and muting layers. didn't yet get to more general smoothed parameters or exposing more OSC controls. probably next time.

also wrote a readme and spent a bit more time on this diary.
